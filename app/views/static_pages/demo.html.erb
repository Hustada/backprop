    <p>Housemade pastas are frequently stunning, as in tortellini brodo ($17), floppy-edged pasta filled with exquisitely creamy, mildly sweet acorn squash in an extraordinarily deep-flavored, teak-toned capon consommé dotted with cubes of carrot and rutabaga. Corzetti ($16) offers similarly dramatic textural and flavor contrast between its phenomenally earthy, concentrated mushroom stock, poker-chip-sized flat discs of pasta, tangy spoonfuls of cow’s-milk Cloumage and sprinkling of dark, crunchy sourdough crumbs. The superb spaghetti with Jonah crab ($18) offers abundant, buttery/briny seafood and lovely, faint accents of green tomato and bacon. Rustic flavors of cauliflower, chickpeas, garlic, dried chili and preserved lemon give tagliatelle ($15) an unexpected North African lilt and surprising richness for a vegetarian dish.

    Entrees showcase Bergin’s subtle flair for North Italian dishes, as in the neatly crisp-skinned, Tuscan-inspired chicken al mattone ($24) made from a very flavorful local bird, heartily flanked with al dente farro, Brussels sprouts, charred cippolinis and mild, fruity Cerignola olives. Picture-pretty lamb saddle ($28) uses fork-tender slices of almost too-mild lamb loin, saved from dullness by the umami-laden ferocity of pureed black garlic. The just-done juiciness of swordfish ($22) with bare dottings of little potatoes and clams exorcises the memory of a hundred dry, overdone versions. The savory Piemontese custard that is sformato ($20) provides the base for another intriguing, beautifully textured vegetarian dish, the custard here torn into chunks and arrayed with sunchoke, black kale, blackened pepperonata and hazelnuts. Desserts ($10) lean light and simple, as in a fine apple crostata, affogato (a bowl of espresso befogged with a scoop of salted-caramel gelato) and velvety rice pudding.

    Four aperitivo cocktails make good use of Italian vermouths and amari, as in L’Avventura ($10), an icy, nicely balanced highball of bittersweet Meletti and Santa Maria al Monte punched up with lemon, mint and nutmeg. The beer list includes four mild, food-friendly styles ($6-$8) and five heftier Italian craft brews ($15). The small waitstaff negotiates the usually packed, comfortably loud room with informal grace and charm.

    Fat Hen’s surprise secret weapon, though, is sommelier Paige Farrell, a veteran of Asta and Menton who brings a nonpareil ebullience and élan to the service of a wittily curated list: nine options by the glass ($11-$14, bottles $44-$56) and 24 bottles ($44-$175, most under $75), including six on a “racconto” list highlighting particular varietals, producers or themes. She deftly guided us to nice-priced delights like the 2010 Pietregiovani ($11/$44), an inky charmer of a Puglian negroamaro with an elegant, barely tannic finish; the 2012 Bussola Ca’ del Laito ($14/$56), a valpolicella ripasso from the Veneto, dropping the smack of a medium-big amarone at a fraction of the price; and the 2014 Eugenio Bocchino “Roccabella” ($75), a Piemontese nebbiolo that poured with intriguing, rough-edged complexity and opened up into something whispery, silky, ravishing.</p>
